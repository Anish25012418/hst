# Coding guide followed by Udip Rai

<!-- These are not necessary meant to be the only ways. Better to treat theses ways as the standard format necessary to code such that coding gets way more easier with recognizable patterns so it wont be much of a hassle to add new functionality with similar approaches. -->

It's a good approach to follow standard formats and recognizable patterns in coding. This not only makes it easier to understand and maintain the code but also facilitates adding new functionality using similar approaches. Standardization can streamline development processes and improve overall code quality. If you need assistance with modifying specific code or implementing new functionality, feel free to ask!


## Basic Rules
1. Please follow alphanumeric rule for all manual codes that you write.
Eg: import {Card, Abstract} from "@/some-folder"
Change this to import {Abstract, Card} ...

This doesnt only imply in imports but in variable namings, states placings and so much more.


## Comments
1. Should always start with a capital first word and the rest in lowercase
2. Ensure correct comments are provided whenever necessary (mostly when dealing with business logic)
